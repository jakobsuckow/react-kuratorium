            <p> The last years saw a massive increase in record labels; most of them with the concept to showcase
                the music of friends and associates. This led to competition in a market that used to flourish
                through coexistence. With the disappearance of previous natural boundaries in the release
                of music, such as financial and capacitative limitations, people from all sides of the scene
                search for excellent curation to find their way in an overcrowded and overwhelming field. 
            </p> 
            <p>
            Still, there are many skilled curators without a platform to curate: DJs lacking the capacities
            or a worked-out concept for an own label; bookers whose curational drive exceeds the boundaries
            of the home institution; label heads with more ideas than one label can cover; producers with
            the abilities to inspire a whole wave of artists; individuals with a vision to share, not a
            taste to show off. 
            </p> 

            <p>
            Kuratorium operates on a project-basis, reducing the urge to release music for the sake of releasing
             something and giving a platform to those who will do something special with it.
             Each project has a different curator with a unique overall topic. The basic idea to distill
            the values of the curator’s vision. There are no artistic or curational boundaries in terms of
            a project’s extent. For each project, every aspect of its operational nature can be defined from
            scratch.
