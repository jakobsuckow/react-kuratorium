          process your data provided by you during the subscription process with
          the purpose of sending you the requested newsletter. We send out the

          3. Communication and Contractual Obligations When you reach out to us
          via email or otherwise, we process the data you provide us with for
          the purpose of performing our obligations with regard to our
          contractual relationship or its preparation and/or any other
          communication purposes. This also includes consulting and information
          requests. In this event, the legal basis for processing your data is
          Art. 6 (1) lit. b) GDPR based on a contractual relationship or the
          initiation of a contractual relationship and/or Article 6 (1) lit. c)
          GDPR where we are legally obliged to do so, in particular pursuant to
          applicable tax and commercial law provisions. In any case, the legal
          basis for processing your contact data is Article 6 (1) lit. f) GDPR,
          our legitimate interest is to enter into the communication with you.
          All data relevant to contracts and book keeping shall be stored for a
          period of ten (10) calendar years after the end of our contractual
          relationship pursuant to obligations based on tax and commercial law
          provisions. The provision of your contact data is obligatory where you
          want us to enter into a communication with you. Contractual
          relationships cannot be established and carried out without the basic
          contractual data.
